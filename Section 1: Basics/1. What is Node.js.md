**Topic 1: What is Node.js**

Node.js is a powerful, open-source, cross-platform runtime environment built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine. It allows you to run JavaScript code outside of the browser, primarily on the server side. Traditionally, JavaScript was used only for client-side scripting (inside the browser), but Node.js revolutionized web development by enabling developers to use JavaScript for server-side logic as well. This means you can build complete web applications — both frontend and backend — using just one language: JavaScript.

At its core, Node.js is designed to build scalable network applications. It uses a non-blocking, event-driven architecture, which makes it ideal for I/O-heavy operations like reading files, querying databases, or handling HTTP requests. Unlike languages that use multi-threading to handle concurrent operations, Node.js uses a single-threaded event loop to manage multiple connections efficiently. This leads to better performance and responsiveness in many real-world scenarios.

Let’s understand this with a small practical example. Open any code editor and create a file named `hello.js`:

```js
// hello.js
console.log("Hello, Node.js!");
```

Now, open your terminal, navigate to the folder where your file is saved, and run:

```bash
node hello.js
```

You’ll see the output:

```
Hello, Node.js!
```

This simple example shows how you can execute JavaScript code directly using Node.js outside of any browser.

But Node.js is not just about running scripts. It also allows you to build web servers and APIs. Here's a basic example of creating a server:

```js
// server.js
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
  res.end('Hello from Node.js server!');
});

server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on http://localhost:3000');
});
```

Run this file with:

```bash
node server.js
```

Then, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`. You’ll see the message: **Hello from Node.js server!**

This basic server example demonstrates the capability of Node.js to handle HTTP requests directly — without needing any external software like Apache or Nginx.

To summarize, Node.js is a runtime that empowers JavaScript to work on the server, enabling you to build fast, scalable, and efficient web applications. It’s the foundation of many modern web stacks (like MERN — MongoDB, Express, React, Node) and continues to be widely used in production for real-time apps, REST APIs, microservices, and more.
