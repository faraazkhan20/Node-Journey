### Topic 3: Running Your First Node Script

Running your first Node.js script is a simple but important step to start your journey with Node.js. Once Node.js is installed on your system, you can write JavaScript code in a file and execute it directly using the Node runtime. This approach lets you test and build server-side JavaScript programs quickly without needing a browser.

To begin, open your favorite code editor or a simple text editor like Notepad or VS Code. Create a new file and name it something like `firstScript.js`. This file will contain your first Node.js code.

Inside `firstScript.js`, write the following simple JavaScript code:

```js
console.log("Hello, Node.js!");
```

This line uses the `console.log()` method, which prints the message inside the parentheses to the console. It's a basic way to output data or debug your code.

Now, save the file and open your terminal or command prompt. Navigate to the folder where you saved `firstScript.js` using the `cd` command. For example, if your file is in the Desktop folder, type:

```bash
cd Desktop
```

Once you're in the correct folder, run your Node.js script using the command:

```bash
node firstScript.js
```

When you press Enter, Node.js executes the JavaScript file, and you should see the output:

```
Hello, Node.js!
```

printed directly in the terminal. This confirms that Node.js is correctly installed and able to run your script.

This simple "Hello World" script is the foundation for more complex applications. From here, you can explore how to use Node.js built-in modules, create servers, handle files, and much more.

If you want to experiment further, try creating a file that outputs the current date and time:

```js
console.log("Current date and time:", new Date());
```

Run it the same way with `node filename.js`. This helps you understand how to execute dynamic JavaScript code on the server.

Another important feature is the **Node REPL** (Read-Eval-Print Loop), which allows you to run JavaScript interactively. Simply open your terminal and type `node` without any file:

```bash
node
```

You’ll enter a prompt where you can type JavaScript commands and immediately see results. For example:

```js
> console.log("Testing REPL");
Testing REPL
undefined
>
```

This environment is perfect for quick experiments and learning.

In summary, running your first Node.js script involves writing JavaScript in a file and using the `node` command to execute it. This workflow lets you test small scripts, debug code, and eventually build complex applications by chaining together many files and modules. It’s the core step to mastering backend JavaScript with Node.js.
