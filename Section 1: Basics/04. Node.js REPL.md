### Topic 4: Node.js REPL

Node.js REPL stands for **Read-Eval-Print Loop**, and it’s a very useful interactive tool that comes bundled with Node.js. The REPL environment allows you to write and execute JavaScript code directly in your terminal or command prompt without creating any files. This makes it perfect for quick testing, debugging, or learning JavaScript and Node.js concepts on the fly.

When you open your terminal and type the command `node` without any filename, you enter the REPL mode. Here, the program reads the JavaScript code you type, evaluates it, prints the result, and then loops back to read the next input. This continuous loop is what makes it an interactive shell.

For example, open your terminal and type:

```bash
node
```

You’ll see a prompt like this:

```
>
```

Now, you can type any JavaScript expression or statement. For instance, typing:

```js
> 2 + 3
```

will immediately output:

```
5
```

This instant feedback is very helpful to quickly test how JavaScript behaves, test functions, or even try out Node.js specific features.

You can also declare variables in the REPL:

```js
> let name = "Alice";
undefined
> console.log(name);
Alice
```

Notice that the REPL returns `undefined` after variable declarations because they do not produce a value themselves.

The REPL also supports multi-line statements. For example, you can write a function like this:

```js
> function greet(name) {
...   return "Hello, " + name + "!";
... }
undefined
> greet("Bob")
'Hello, Bob!'
```

The `...` prompt appears because Node.js waits for you to finish the multi-line block.

Another powerful feature is that you can load Node.js modules and use built-in libraries directly:

```js
> const os = require('os');
undefined
> os.platform()
'linux'
```

This allows you to experiment with modules without creating separate files, speeding up development and learning.

You can exit the REPL anytime by typing `.exit` or pressing `Ctrl + C` twice.

Additionally, REPL has special commands starting with a dot (`.`), like `.help` to show available commands or `.clear` to reset the session.

In summary, Node.js REPL is a simple but powerful interactive environment to write and run JavaScript code immediately. It’s a great way to learn JavaScript syntax, test Node.js features, and debug your code quickly without the overhead of saving files or restarting programs. Using REPL effectively can speed up your learning and development process tremendously.
