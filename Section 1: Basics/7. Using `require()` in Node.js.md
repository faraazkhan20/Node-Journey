### Topic 7: Using `require()` in Node.js

The `require()` function in Node.js is a built-in function used to load modules. A module in Node.js is a reusable block of code whose existence does not accidentally impact other code. This helps keep code organized, modular, and maintainable. Using `require()`, you can import both built-in Node.js modules, third-party modules, or your own custom modules into your files.

At its core, `require()` takes one argument—a path to the module—and returns whatever that module exports. For instance, to use Node.js's built-in `fs` module for file system operations, you can write:

```js
const fs = require('fs');
```

This line loads the `fs` module and stores its exports in the `fs` variable. You can now use any method provided by `fs`, such as reading or writing files.

```js
fs.readFile('example.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(data);
});
```

Besides core modules, you can also require third-party packages installed via npm. For example, after running `npm install moment`, you can import and use it like this:

```js
const moment = require('moment');
console.log("Current time is:", moment().format('HH:mm:ss'));
```

More commonly, you'll be using `require()` to load **your own modules**. Suppose you have two files: `main.js` and `math.js`. In `math.js`, define:

```js
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

module.exports = { add };
```

Now in `main.js`, you can load and use this module:

```js
const math = require('./math');
console.log("Sum is:", math.add(5, 3));
```

Notice the `./` prefix in the path when requiring local files. Without it, Node will look for a core or npm module instead.

The `module.exports` object in the required file is what gets returned by `require()`. You can export functions, objects, variables, or even entire classes.

Node.js caches required modules. This means if a module is required multiple times, Node returns the same instance from the cache, improving performance. However, this also means changes to the module’s state (like adding to an exported object) will persist across all uses.

Lastly, `require()` is synchronous, meaning the rest of your code waits for the module to be loaded. While this isn’t usually a problem for small modules, it’s one reason to avoid using `require()` inside performance-critical or loop-heavy parts of your code.

In summary, `require()` is a powerful feature in Node.js for importing functionality into your files, whether it's built-in, third-party, or your own. Mastering how to use and structure modules with `require()` is key to writing clean and scalable Node.js applications.
