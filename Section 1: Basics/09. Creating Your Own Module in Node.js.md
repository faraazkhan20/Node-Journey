### Topic 9: Creating Your Own Module in Node.js

Creating your own module in Node.js is simple and powerful. A **module** is just a JavaScript file that exports functionality which can be reused in other files. This helps split code into small, manageable pieces—keeping logic organized and maintainable.

When you create a new `.js` file, Node automatically treats it as a module. Anything you define in that file stays local unless you explicitly expose it using `module.exports`. This local scope prevents variable clashes and helps encapsulate logic.

Let’s walk through creating a custom module step by step.

First, create a file named `greetings.js`. In it, define some functions:

```js
// greetings.js
function sayHello(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

function sayGoodbye(name) {
  return `Goodbye, ${name}!`;
}

// Export the functions
module.exports = {
  sayHello,
  sayGoodbye
};
```

This module has two functions and exports them as an object. Now, create a separate file, say `app.js`, and use the module there:

```js
// app.js
const greetings = require('./greetings');

console.log(greetings.sayHello("Ankit"));
console.log(greetings.sayGoodbye("Ankit"));
```

Here, `require('./greetings')` loads the custom module, giving access to its exported methods. Note that `./` tells Node to look in the current folder.

You can also export a single function directly, without wrapping it in an object:

```js
// welcome.js
module.exports = function(name) {
  return `Welcome, ${name}!`;
};
```

Then in `app.js`, you’d use:

```js
const welcome = require('./welcome');
console.log(welcome("Ankit"));
```

Behind the scenes, every module in Node.js is wrapped in a function like:

```js
(function(exports, require, module, __filename, __dirname) {
  // your code
});
```

That’s why `module.exports` and `require()` work.

You can also organize multiple modules in a folder. Create a folder `utils`, and inside it place multiple `.js` files, each handling different logic. For example:

```js
// utils/math.js
module.exports.add = (a, b) => a + b;

// utils/logger.js
module.exports.log = (msg) => console.log("[LOG]", msg);
```

Then in your main file:

```js
const math = require('./utils/math');
const logger = require('./utils/logger');

logger.log("Addition Result: " + math.add(5, 3));
```

This approach is very common in real-world applications where logic is divided into services, controllers, routers, and utilities.

In summary, creating your own module involves writing code in a separate file, exporting it using `module.exports`, and importing it using `require()`. It makes your code cleaner, easier to test, and reusable across different parts of your application.
