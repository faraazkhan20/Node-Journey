### Topic 2: Installing Node.js

Before building anything with Node.js, you first need to install it on your system. Node.js runs outside the browser, so having it installed on your machine allows you to execute JavaScript code directly from the terminal or command prompt. Along with Node.js, you also get **npm** (Node Package Manager), which is essential for managing packages (libraries, tools, and frameworks) in your projects.

#### Step 1: Download Node.js

To begin, go to the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org). You’ll find two versions:

* **LTS (Long Term Support)** – Recommended for most users; it’s more stable.
* **Current** – Includes the latest features but may not be as stable.

If you're just starting out or working on real-world projects, go with the **LTS** version.

#### Step 2: Installing on Windows

1. Download the `.msi` installer for Windows.
2. Run the installer and follow the steps (click “Next” and leave everything as default).
3. Once installation is complete, open **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell** and check if Node is installed:

```bash
node -v
```

This will show the Node.js version installed (e.g., `v20.11.1`).

To check if `npm` was installed successfully:

```bash
npm -v
```

This displays the npm version (e.g., `10.5.0`). If both commands show version numbers, you're good to go.

#### Step 3: Installing on macOS

1. The easiest way is to use **Homebrew** (if installed). Run:

```bash
brew install node
```

2. Alternatively, download the macOS installer from the Node.js website and follow the GUI steps just like on Windows.

3. After installation, verify it in your Terminal:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

#### Step 4: Installing on Linux

Depending on your distro, you can use a package manager. For Debian/Ubuntu-based systems:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nodejs npm
```

You can also install a specific version using Node Version Manager (**nvm**), which is recommended:

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc
nvm install --lts
```

Then verify installation:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

#### Step 5: Writing and Running Your First Node Script

Now that Node.js is installed, let’s write your first real JavaScript file to test it.

1. Open any code editor (like VS Code).
2. Create a file named `app.js`.
3. Add this code:

```js
console.log("Node.js is installed and working!");
```

4. Save the file and run it in your terminal:

```bash
node app.js
```

You should see the output:

```
Node.js is installed and working!
```

#### Conclusion

Installing Node.js is a one-time process that sets up your system to run JavaScript from the terminal and manage packages with npm. Once installed, you're ready to start building real backend applications, command-line tools, and full-stack web projects.
